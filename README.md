# TENQ
TENQ - tiny engine for novels and quests

With this engine, you can easily create some kind of text quest or even a novel, it all depends on your imagination. You don't have to be good at programming to make a game, but if you do, the engine's capabilities multiply. 

In this repository, along with the TENQ engine, there is also an example quest called "Last Dialogue", and the whole game is in the Data.cs file.

TENQ is built on the Xamarin.Forms 4.4.2 library.

Of course, the engine is not finished yet, but even now you can create your own game without any problems. Check it out by playing sample!
